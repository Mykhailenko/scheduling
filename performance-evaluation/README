Performance tests runs agains current repository.
Before run performance evaluation you have to configure:
	
 - 'scheduling/performance-evaluation/config.ini'
	- set USERNAME, and PASSWORD properties
 - 'scheduling/config/scheduler/settings.ini'
	- pa.scheduler.core.nodepingfrequency 1
	- pa.scheduler.core.node.ping.attempts 600
 - 'config/rm/settings.ini'
	- pa.rm.nodes.recovery true
	- pa.rm.preserve.nodes.on.shutdown false

In order to run node (task) recovery test you have to start 
./nodeRecovery.sh %MIN_WORKERS% %MAX_WORKERS% [ %STEP = 10 ]
(./taskRecovery.sh %MIN_WORKERS% %MAX_WORKERS% [ %STEP = 10 ])

It will execute series of experiments changing number of workers, e.g.
./nodeRecovery 10 30 
- will run 3 experiments with 10, 20, and 30 workers. 

Results of this series is saved in /scheduling/performance-evaluation/storage/allruns


Performance evaluation run on 'localInfrastructure' where we start as './proactive-server -ln 0' 
and './proactive-node -w 50 -Dproactive.node.reconnection.attempts=100'. (50 is a number of wrokers we want to start on the node).
